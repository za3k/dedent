'dedent' is a small script to convert hierarchical, indented files into something which can easily be sent into standard unix tools.  The program 'indent' performs the reverse transformation

Sample input and output can be seen by running dedent on any of the files in the included example folder.

Caveats:
    - The output includes trailing whitespace.  Make sure not to trim it.
    - Escape sequences are not honored, and 'dedent' pays no particular attention to common string sequences.
